            . Previously, she was a research scientist in the Machine Learning
            Department at Carnegie Mellon University. <br />
            <br />
            Dr. Lee has conducted some of the first studies that empirically
            examine the social implications of algorithmsâ€™ emerging roles in
            management and governance in society. She has extensive expertise in
            developing theories, methods and tools for human-centered AI and
            deploying them in practice through collaboration with real-world
            stakeholders and organizations. She developed a participatory
            framework that empowers community members to design matching
            algorithms that govern their own communities.
            <br />
            <br />
            Her current research is inspired by and complements her previous
            work on social robots for long-term interaction, seamless
            human-robot handovers, and telepresence robots.
            <br />
            <br />
            Dr. Lee is a Siebel Scholar and has received the Allen Newell Award
            for Research Excellence, research grants from NSF and Uptake, and
            eight best paper awards and honorable mentions and two demo/video
            awards in venues such as CHI, CSCW, DIS, HRI and MobiSys. She is an
