        >. Previously, she was a research scientist in the Machine Learning
        Department at Carnegie Mellon University. <br />
        <br />

        Dr. Lee has conducted some of the first studies that empirically examine
        the social implications of algorithms’ emerging roles in management and
        governance in society. She has extensive expertise in developing
        theories, methods and tools for human-centered AI and deploying them in
        practice through collaboration with real-world stakeholders and
        organizations. She developed a participatory framework that empowers
        community members to design matching algorithms that govern their own
        communities.

        <br />
        <br />

        Her current research is inspired by and complements her previous work on
        social robots for long-term interaction, seamless human-robot handovers,
        and telepresence robots.

        <br />
        <br />

        Dr. Lee is a Siebel Scholar and has received the Allen Newell Award for
        Research Excellence, research grants from NSF and Uptake, and eight best
        paper awards and honorable mentions and two demo/video awards in venues
        such as CHI, CSCW, DIS, HRI and MobiSys. She is an Associate Editor of

        from 2017-2023. Her work has been featured in media outlets such as the
        New York Times, New Scientist, Washington Post, MIT Technology Review
        and CBS. She received a PhD and a MS in Human-Computer Interaction and
        an MDes in Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon University and a BS
        from KAIST.
