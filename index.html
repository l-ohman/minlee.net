            <p>
              I am a human-computer interaction researcher who combines computer
              science, design, and social science theories and methods. I
              conducted some of the first studies that empiricially examine the
              AI's social implications on

              to address the misalignment between AI assumptions and stakeholder
              priorities.

            <p>
              My vision is that <span id="biohighlight">Participatory AI</span>,
              which enables stakeholder participation across the AI development
              cycle, can better align AI with stakeholde priorities and
              contribute to creating just, empowering workplaces and cities.

              I strive to translate my research into pragmatic systems and
              processes to make the real-world impact or support organizations

        <p id="project_description">Ridesharing services are example contexts of emerging algorithmic management, where
          algorithms take managerial roles such as assignment, incentivization and evaluation. My qualitative study of
          Uber and Lyft drivers shows how people work with algorithms. Some of the highlights are below.

          <br>
          <br>



          The importance of transparency: The lack of algorithmic transparency hurts worker cooperation and trust,
          particularly in cases of service breakdowns—such as assignments that are far away or do not make sense.
          <br> <br>


          Gaps between algorithmic assumptions and human behaviors: Assignment algorithms automated ride assignments,
          giving little control to the drivers, so drivers created their own workarounds to regain control. Evaluation
          algorithms used quantified metrics, but drivers felt they were unfair because they did not account for
          important nuances and contexts. The surge pricing algorithm was not very successful in sending drivers to
          areas with high demand, because drivers had ergonomic constraints and diverse motivations beyond financial
          incentives.

        <p id="project_description">How do individuals perceive algorithmic vs. group-made decisions? We investigated
          people’s perceptions of mathematically-proven fair division algorithms making social division decisions. In
          our first qualitative study, about one third of the participants perceived algorithmic decisions as less than
          fair (30% for self, 36% for group), often because algorithmic assumptions about users did not account for
          multiple concepts of fairness or social behaviors, and the process of quantifying preferences through
          interfaces was prone to error. In our second experiment, algorithmic decisions were perceived to be less fair
          than discussion-based decisions, dependent on participants’ interpersonal power and computer programming
          knowledge. Our work suggests that for algorithmic mediation to be fair, algorithms and their interfaces
          should account for social and altruistic behaviors that may be difficult to define in mathematical terms.

          <p id="project_description">We are in the process of building an allocation algorithm for 412 Food Rescue, an
            organization that matches food donations with non-profit organizations. As part of this ongoing project, we
            studied what fair allocation means to multiple stakeholders in the service—organization staff, donors,
            volunteers, recipient non-profits and their clients, and everyday citizens. Fairness implies a combination
            of efficiency, equity, and equality, and different stakeholders have varying concepts. The equity model
            requires some way to define “levels of need,” while the equality model treats all recipient organizations
            the same.

          <p id="project_description">As a city becomes smarter, integrated networks of engineered cyber and physical
            elements provide the capability to greatly improve the quality of life of its citizens. In order to
            leverage these capabilities to benefit all classes of society, this project aims to develop a
            proof-of-concept for a socially responsible smart city that utilizes its cyber-physical infrastructure to
            better manage services, monitor the needs of citizens, and maximize the social welfare of myriad
            stakeholders including the government, private citizens, and NGOs. This research is supported by NSF grants
            #1651858 and #1651566.
